print("hello, welcome to calculator")
<br>
a=int((input)("enter the first number"))
<br>
b=int((input)("enter thhe second number"))
<br>
print("addition of those numbers is ",a+b)
<br>
print("subtraction of those numbers is", a-b)
<br>
print("multplication of those numbers is", a*b)
<br>
print("division of those numbers is", a/b)

This project was my first dive into Python programming, and those seven lines of code I wrote as a beginner felt like a huge win.
Now, as I work on a more advanced calculator, I'm reliving that same sense of accomplishment and excitement.
